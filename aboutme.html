	<div class="body"><p>I am an enthusiastic, passionate person who loves helping others. I always enjoy whatever it is I'm doing, and I try to give it my best. I like working with others, because I firmly believe teamwork is essential to all aspects of life. I like sports, traveling, and the [more than] occassional politics conversation. Wherever I am, and whatever I'm doing, I hope all of these things are still true. </p></div>
