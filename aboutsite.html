	<div class="title">Why Make this?</div>
	<div class="body"><p>This site is the culmination of a series of projects made for the class "Communications Lab" in New York University Abu Dhabi. I've gone beyond what was intended and made it my personal portfolio. I believe that in this day and age one needs a virtual presentation card as much as a physical one. When I started the class, I had trouble designing a website that actually looked good. During the semester, the projects I worked on helped me ignite my creative side a little bit more. I hope you enjoy the design of this website, which I've created using knowledge from the Communcations Lab class as well as tips and ideas grabbed from sites like www.envato.com and www.makeuseof.com. </p></div>
